Welcome to my first hobby project!
I'm trying to build a platform which enables me to write plugins quickly and with a nice gui.
This is mostly for fun and to learn.
I'm pretty sure there are Platforms which are by far superior.

Right now it's still in EXTREMLY early development.
If you have any suggestions or tips for a beginner, feel free to create issues.

Planned Plugins are:
- Admin Panel
- Minecraft Server manager
- Factorio Server Manager
- Webdav Module

I'm also searching for a code-buddy. Programming alone can be a bit boring.
