Permissions are based on a tree, simialar to a file path

Permissions can be found for different entities -> for now users and modules (maybe tokens?)

If you have a permission, all sub-permissions are granted too
The highest permission is / (root)
A module can only edit permissions of a users which reside in it's own subtree:
e.g.: Module Minecraft:
/modules/minecraft/ViewServer - allowed
/modules/minecraft/ViewServer/Server2 - allowed
/modules/minecraft - allowed
/core/addUser - forbidden

A Module can't edit it's own permission if it doesn't have the required permission to do that itself
Permissions can be editet in the AdminPanelV2
