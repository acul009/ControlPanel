Saveables have to be loaded with the help of a filters.
Filters should support basic operations like AND, OR and NOT
Filters should be able to filter Indices for EQUAL, NOT_EQUAL, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN and IN
Filters should be able to filter by ID
Filters do not need to filter for object properties. All things that should be filtered need to be indexed.

Indices can support the following operations:
Interger    -   EQUAL, NOT_EQUAL, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN, IN
Float       -   EQUAL, NOT_EQUAL, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN, IN
Bool        -   EQUAL, NOT_EQUAL
String      -   EQUAL, NOT_EQUAL, IN (Hashed)
Others      -   Serialize to String - Sensitive to array and object internal sortOrder
